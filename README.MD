## Features
1. Allows adjustment of the mini-map north strategy: North is either always upwards or always based on the character's orientation.
2. Through the camera rendering strategy, you can toggle between displaying real terrain or pre-baked base maps.
3. You can choose whether to record the character’s path and display it on the mini-map.
4. Configurable icons and base map definitions.

## Drawbacks
1. The base map is a single-layer 2D image or texture, and cannot display multi-level or 3D mini-maps and world maps.

## Notes
1. When using the world map, you need to calculate the scale; refer to the Demo for guidance.
2. Include Chinese in Code
